A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A broken clock is right twice a day
Acid test
Actions speak louder than words
Add insnult to injury
Against the clock
Ahead of time
Ahead of the curve
An arm and a leg
Around the clock
Around the corner
As time goes by
At the drop of a hat
Back to basics
Back to the drawing board
Bad apple
Ball is in your court
Barking up the wrong tree
Be glad to see the back of 
Beat around the bush
Beat the clock
Bee in one's bonnet
Behind the times
Bells and whistles
Best of both worlds
Best thing since sliced bread
Better late than never
Bide one's time
Big cheese
Bite off more than you can chew
Black and blue
Black and white
Black eye
Black market
Black out
Black sheep
Blackball
Blacklist
Blackmail
Blessing in disguise
Blind date
Blood red
Blood, sweat, and tears
Blow a fuse
Blue blood
Blue collar
Blue in the face
Blue ribbon
Bookworm
Born with a silver spoon in their mouth
Brainstorm
Bread-winner
Bring home the bacon
Buckle down
Bun in the oven
Burn the midnight oil
Butter up
By the skin of your teeth
Call it a day
Call it a night
Calling time
Carry the torch
Cash cow
Cat burglar
Caught red handed
Chase rainbows
Chase your tail
Cheesy
Clock-in
Clock-out
Close to home
Cold shoulder
Coming of age
Cook someone's goose
Copycat
Costs an arm and a leg
Couch potato
Cover a lot of ground
Crack of dawn
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Crunch time
Cry over spilt milk
Curiosity killed the Cat
Cut corners
Cut the mustard
Cut the cheese
Cut to the chase
Dead in the water
Dead weight
Deliver the goods
Devil's advocate
Do time
Don't count your chickens before they're hatched
Don't give up your day job
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Drawing a blank
Dwell on the past
Eager beaver
Easy as ABC
Eat, sleep, and breathe
Egg head
Elbow room
Eleventh hour
Elvis has left the building
Every cloud has a silver lining
Explore all avenues
Eye-catching
Far cry from
Feeling blue
Feeling under the weather
Fever pitch
Fill in the blanks
First out the gate
Fish out of water
Foot in the door
For the time being
From now on
From time to time
Full of beans
Getting sacked
Getting axed
Getting the show on the road
Getting one's ducks in a row
Green thumb
Green with envy
Green light
Grey area
Hanging on by fingernails
Hard as nails
Head in the clouds
Head over heels
Heard through the grapevine
Heart in the right place
High time
Hit the books
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the big time
Hit the road
Hit the sack
Hit the hay
Hit the sheets
Hold down the fort
Hot potato
Hour of need
In due course
In someone's black book
In the bag
In the black
In the blink of an eye
In the heat of the moment
In the long run
In the nick of time
In the red
It takes two to tango
Judge a book by it cover
Jump on the bandwagon
Kept at bay
Keeping your finger on the pulse
Kept in the dark
Killing time
Killing two birds with one stone
Landslide victory
Last straw
Straw that broke the camel's back
Learning the ropes
Licking your wounds
Let slip through one's fingers
Let the cat out of the bag
Lights are one but nobody is home
Like clockwork
Long arm of the law
Long time no see
Look on the bright side
Lump in your throat
Make my day
Make time
Making your skin crawl
Making a go of it
Making good time
Making headway
Match made in heaven
Method to the madness
Mile a minute
Miss the boat
Being in the same boat
Monkey business
Never in a million years
Not playing with a full deck
Off one's rocker
Off to a flying start
Old hand
Old school
On the ball
On the rocks
Once in a blue moon
Once upon a time
Only time will tell
Out of the blue
Out of the red
Out of time
Paint the town red
Pass with flying colors
Penny for your thoughts
A picture paints a thousand words
Piece of cake
Pitch black
Place in the sun
Pop the question
Pot calling the kettle black
Pressed for time
Pull the plug
Pull wool over one's eyes
Pulling out all the stops
Punch above one's weight
Puppy love
Put your thinking cap on
Rags to riches
Raining cats and dogs
Raise the white flag
Raring to go
Rat race
Red flag
Red herring
Red Hot
Red in the face
Red tape
Red-eye
Roll out the red carpet
School of hard knocks
School of thought
Seeing eye to eye
Seeing red
Selling ice to Eskimos
Shelf life
Show of hands
Shown a red card
Silver screen
Single file
Sink or swim
Sink your teeth into
Sitting on the fence
Skipping class
Slice of the pie
Smash hit
Sour grapes
Spanner in the works
Speak of the Devil
Speaks volumes
Spill the beans
Standing your ground
Standing the test of time
Steal someone's thunder
A stiff upper lip
Storm in a teacup
Straight from the horse's mouth
Stuck in a time warp
Swallow one's pride
Sweet tooth
Take each day as it comes
Take with a pinch fo salt
Taste of your own medicine
Teacher's pet
The big time
The moment of truth
The ship has sailed
The time is ripe
Thinking on your feet
This day and age
Tickled pink
Tie the knot
Time after time
Time flies
Time for a change
Time heals all wounds
Time is money
Time is of the essence
Time of your life
Time on one's hands
Time is on one's side
Tongue-tied
Tough cookie
Tricks of the trade
Showing one's true colors
Turning back the hands of time
Until hell freezes over
Up in smoke
Waiting in the wings
Walking out on someone
Wasting time
Well-oiled machine
White as a sheet
White collar
White elephant
Whitewash
Whole nine yards
Works like a charm
Wouldn't be caught dead
Year in, year out
Yellow-bellied
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Catch-22
Down to earth
Get your act together
Jump the gun
Keep your chin up
Let the dust settle
Making ends meet
On cloud nine
Pull yourself together
Read between the lines
Shot in the dark
Spill the tea
Take the bull by the horns
When pigs fly
Wrap your head around
Beat a dead horse
Kick the bucket
Break the ice
Barking mad
Fit as a fiddle
Over the moon
Put a sock in it
Throw in the towel
Under the gun
Wild goose chase
Between a rock and a hard place
All ears
Ants in your pants
Backseat driver
Bear with me
Bend someone's ear
The bottom line
Chip on your shoulder
Clear as mud
Driven up the wall
Get a grip
Get a life
Get the picture
Give someone a hand
Go bananas
Go nuts
Hit the ceiling
Hold your horses
In hot water
In the doghouse
Lose your marbles
Spring chicken
Off the hook
On the fence
Out of the woods
Paint yourself into a corner
Pull a fast one
Ring a bell
Stick your neck out
Take a rain check
Through thick and thin
A dime a dozen
Ace in the hole
All bark and no bite
Armed to the teeth
Asleep at the wheel
Basket case
Blow off steam
Bouncing off the walls
Can of worms
Cat got your Tongue
Chew the fat
Clean as a whistle
Cut and dried
Down for the count
Drop in the bucket
Face the music
Fall off the wagon
Go down in flames
Grasping at straws
Graveyard shift
Hair of the dog
Having a bone to pick
Hitting below the belt
Holding your tongue
In a pickle
In stitches
In the doghouse
Jumping ship
Keeping your chin up
Kiss of death
Knock it off
Making waves
Learning the ropes
Monday morning quarterback
No dice
Off base
Out of the blue
Out of the loop
Out of the question
Par for the course
Play by ear
Putting your cards on the table
Raising eyebrows
Run of the mill
Shooting from the hip
Skating on thin ice
Sleep on it
Smelling a rat
Sticking to your guns
Take the cake
Two left feet
Turning a blind eye
Tip of the iceberg
Winging it
Ace up your sleeve
Burning bridges
Down in the dumps
Wolf in sheep's clothing
Eating your words
Being all thumbs
At the end of your rope
Back to square one
Bending over backwards
Bringing down the house
Burying the hatchet 
Calling the shots
Caught with pants down
Chomping at the bit
Cut your teeth on
Down to the wire
Drinking like a fish
Driving a hard bargain
Eating like a bird
Falling on deaf ears
Fish or cut bait
Fly off the handle
Going against the grain
Having a field day
Hitting the ground running
Getting down to brass tacks
Cream of the crop
Holding your peace
Keeping your shirt on
Kicking up your heels
Leaving no stone unturned
Knock your socks off
Jumping through hoops
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Nipping it in the bud
On pins and needles
Picking your brain
Picking up the slack
Playing second fiddle
Racking your brains
Rise and shine
Rubbing salt in the wound
Sharp as a tack
Taking it on the chin
Thick as thieves
Ship shape
Setting your sights on
Running circles around
Scratching the surface
Across the board
Adding fuel to the fire
All hands on deck
Back against the wall
Bark is worse than bite
Burning the candle at both ends
Beating someone to the punch
Bet your bottom dollar
Calling a spade a spade
Changing horses midstream
Eating crow
Dropping the ball
Getting the short end of the stick
Having an axe to grind
Coming out of left field
Falling by the wayside
Breaking the bank
Holds water
Keeping your wits about you
In full swing
Kick up a fuss
Leaving a bad taste in one's mouth
Locking horns
Pinning your hopes on
Playing your cards right
Putting your foot down
Neither fish nor fowl
Off the cuff
Out of sorts
Paint by numbers
Paying through the nose
Pear-shaped
Making hay while the sun shines
Right as rain
Rough and ready
Salt of the earth
Separate the wheat from the chaff
Shake a leg
Skeleton in the closet
Six of one, half dozen of the other
Small potatoes
Step up to the plate
Strike while the iron is hot
Take a back seat
Taking the wind out of someone's sails
Throwing your hat in the ring
Toe the line
Turning the tables
Wearing your heart on your sleeve
Having a whale of a time
Whipped into shape
Working your fingers to the bone
Yanking someone's chain
Achilles' heel
Zipping your lips
All that glitters is not gold
Biting the dust
Eating you alive
Diamond in the rough
Cooking with gas
Cooking up a storm
Dog days
Digging in your heels
Dead to the world
Flash in the pan
Getting wind of
Going haywire
Grease monkey
Half-baked
Half-hearted
Hard to swallow
Having fingers in more than one pie
The lion's share
Making ends meet
Off the beaten path
Playing possum
Putting the cart before the horse
Rank and file
Salad days
Rub the wrong way
Shooting the breeze
Snap up
Starting from scratch
Strong arming
Top brass
Until the cows come home
Thumbing your nose at
Third wheel
Tall order
Striking gold
Take a hike
Train of thought
Showing your true colors
Under wraps
Upper crust
Walking on eggshells
Wearing many hats
Water under the bridge
Bad blood
Blowing your stack
