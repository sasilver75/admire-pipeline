- `en_idioms.txt`: A list of English idioms. The hope is that this list of idioms doesn't contain any of the idioms that are in SemEval english idiom list. Those should ALSO make their way into the final dataset, but not into the dataset for which we finetune a model to use against the SemEval dataset as a validation set.
    - Thought: Actually, is it fine if those idioms are in the dataset, since the images that we generate are goign to be different than the images in the SemEval dataset?
